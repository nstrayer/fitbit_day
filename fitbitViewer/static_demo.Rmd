```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading Data

In the shiny app this data will be pulled down from the api but for demo purposes I have exported a set of data for 8 days. 

```{r}
mydata <- read.csv('../docs/fitbit_data.csv')
head(mydata)
```

## Plotting the tagging interface

Now we can simply call the html widget from here. 

```{r}
fitbitViewer::fitbitViz(mydata)
```
